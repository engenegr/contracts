Create an alias for your etleneum account ID

Why add an alias?

So that you can provide two way links and prove that identities are reciprocal.  To complete the process add a link back from your remote identity

Why would you want to link an identity?

Because different identities on the decentralized web offer different features.  One for payments, one for contracts, one for trust, one for chat etc.

Functions:

Add: allows you to add a full URI to your alias
Delete: allows you to remove one

Do not send satoshis to this contract as they will be burnt and unusable
